This is a FastAPI backend endpoint that is designed to be spun up in a docker container.

Once the container is running the documentation can be found at the /ui endpoint.

The end point uses a postgre database to store various customer information, for specifics please see the openapi.yaml file

The docker image can be spun up using the startup.sh script on UNIX based machines.

This was written in 5 days, and single handedly! As I was in an arm sling.
